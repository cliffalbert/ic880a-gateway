# The Things Network: iC880a-based gateway

Reference setup for [The Things Network](http://thethingsnetwork.org/) gateways based on the iC880a SPI concentrator with a Raspberry Pi host.

This is my first attempt at upgrading the installer to the latest Packet Forwarder and libloragw from semtech.


## Setup

Check [a step-by-step HOWTO in our wiki](https://github.com/ttn-zh/ic880a-gateway/wiki) for a detailed explanation of the hardware that needs to be purchased and the software setup you will have to configure. 

## Installation

- Clone the installer and start the installation

        $ git clone https://github.com/ttn-zh/ic880a-gateway.git ~/ic880a-gateway
        $ cd ~/ic880a-gateway
        $ sudo ./install.sh spi

## Update

If you have a running gateway and want to update, simply run the installer again:

        $ cd ~/ic880a-gateway
        $ sudo ./install.sh spi

These scripts are largely based on the awesome work by [Ruud Vlaming](https://github.com/devlaam) on the [Lorank8 installer](https://github.com/Ideetron/Lorank).
